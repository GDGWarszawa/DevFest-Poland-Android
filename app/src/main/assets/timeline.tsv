The presentation starts with a short introduction to SELinux and its impact on Android. Rémy & Guillaume will show the best practices to grant a service new access rights under SELinux.   SELinux has been progressively making its way to Android. It can be a pain to configure but is now here to stay. Because disabling SELinux is never a solution, Rémy & Guillaume started to study it’s mechanism as they worked on rom cooking.

It’s deeply integrated into Android Studio and features more than 200 default checks. It’s possible to extend this powerful tool, but how?    By writing custom Lint rules for large enterprise Android projects for more than two years now, André gained comprehensive hands-on experience with Lint. Unfortunately official documentation on how to write custom Lint rules is rare and deprecated. When it comes to testing or operating these rules you won’t find any official documentation.

She could finally use all the libraries she had wanted to use for a long time.    At this point in time, Jolanda is using Butterknife, Universal Image Loader, OkHttp, GSon, EventBus, RxAndroid / RxJava, Mosby, Icepick, FragmentArgs, and a lot of UI libraries on top of that. Each of those libraries has its perks and Jolanda is eager to share with you her experiences.
