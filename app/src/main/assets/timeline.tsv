We know one of the main characteristics of Java is portability, and that usually means it is not as efficient as it should be. That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.   In this session you will not only learn how to make your Android code faster but also what to avoid when looking for critical performance and a bigger understanding of how the Java compiler works, and how these small changes affect to Dalvik VM and the new ART runtime.

In some cases, as when developing a new product, adding customised apps is not enough, and OS modifications are required.   To be able to modify Android at its core, Daniele will show the complete process, from setting the correct environment, configuring the different Google’s repositories and downloading the source code, to understand the structure of the source code and how to modify it.   Conclusion: The attendees will be able to customize the Android OS to address the needs of a new product, editing some features normally hidden to normal apps.	Erasmus Room 1

C++ could sound very scary, but the latest versions of C++ have improved a lot the way of working with it. Now with C++ 11 developers can develop faster and safer (very nice patterns and tool for the memory management, threading, etc)   Conclusion: If you want to maintain the nice user experience of each platform, it is not a good idea to use a magical solution that will create a unified UI for all the platforms. With C++ the developers can create a common core written with c++ that can be connected with the UI in order to provide the best user experience of each platform. For instance, Dropbox uses this way of working.	University Room

In this talk Peter will showcase his own story of how he developed an Android App for a gadget used to help keep his insulin safe. Peter normally uses Arduino and similar tools for his projects, but for this project he preferred to use relayr’s WunderBar and code a simple Android app.   relayr created the WunderBar to enable software developers to add a wireless hardware component to their apps. Peter will show how WunderBar enables app developers like himself to quickly build apps with physical components. So if you would like to hear Peter’s true story and learn about best practices to produce Android-compatible BLE gadgets, this talk is a must see.	Erasmus Room 1

In Android one can use dynamic code loading to instantiate multiple class loaders. This way you break down your app in smaller pieces and rebuild- deploy only those. If only resources has changed, there is no reason to rebuild and reinstall the whole app. Just upload the piece of it to the sd card and enjoy the increased speed of your development.   Conclusion: There is a big room for improvement in Android gradle build system. This is only one of the ways to speed up. Hacking on gradle is way easier it used to be on Ant and you can now learn how Booking.com does it.	Erasmus Room 2

Even worse, if your app also includes a vulnerable WebView component, attackers can exploit missing or broken SSL to inject a malicious payload to gain unauthorised remote access to your user’s device.   During this talk you will be shown how they exploit this to remotely take over your phone, steal your files, record video and upload some disturbing files that might raise questions from you wife.   David & Yorick will present their research in which they analysed popular global and local Android apps on both issues. This research resulted in a large number of security updates pushed by large companies affecting over 500.000.000 devices.   Still working hard on a new platform, at the end of the talk they hope to introduce a beta release of a new (free) platform that can be used to check your apps.	University Room

We consider use cases of Android environmental sensing in respect to a present and future Internet of things. To this end, we take several hardware devices as examples and connect them together. The examples include Nexus mobile devices, Node+ sensors, and the Intel Galileo IoT development computer. We’ll study the Node+ Android SDK and learn how to implement basic sensor applications using the Node+ API. Also examined is the role of messaging when sensors and other IoT nodes go off and come online again. To this end, you will learn how to install and configure a MQTT broker and connect the Nexus and Galileo to it.	Erasmus Room 1

By using new features based on the Beacons technology, hotels staff can create new scenarios based on the location of the client in the hotel. For example, when a user approaches the spa or the restaurant, one can access custom information about the individual and make individualised offers.   In his work on the Android application the first thing Julien found out is that there are no videos about the subject of beacons on Android, and only a few blog articles that only cover the basics. After trying first implementations, the observation was that there are a lot of key issues, which are not no simple to resolve. There are differences on how devices work, and several bugs that can be tricky to apprehend. Finally the eco-system and the variety of existing beacons providers and SDK are quite challenging.

Szabolcs Becze will discuss in detail how the BLE and ANT+ wireless technologies solve this problem, what is their advantages and disadvantages and how it can be used in Android.   The BLE and ANT+ technologies are designed to solve the same problem but in very different way. They are both good choices in many different areas where low energy consumption and portability is a requirement. Such an area is the fitness world where the different sensors should be able to gather data for month if not years without charging and send them on demand wirelessly to another device. As a case study Szabolcs will analyze how the Garmin Vivofit band can be accessed by an Android Device and how it can read/write data using BLE. We will also connect a Heart Rate monitor both with the Android device and the Vivofit band.	Erasmus Room 2

In this talk Rene Mertins describes the basics about the format, how to create, distribute and use it. The main focus relies on the fact that how to use this format is not well documented and took some research to figure out. This talk gets everyone ready to start using AAR.   As a SDK distributor Rene and his team started early to evaluate the new format to distribute library projects in a comfortable way. Based on this work they figured out that the clue is to distribute and maintain AAR libraries in maven repositories.   Conclusion: Any developer who got this information can create AAR packages, publish them to locale or remote maven repositories using gradle. After this talk you will know how to use aar libs in android studio for your projects.	Erasmus Room 1

Newly introduced structures will be clearly explained together with helpful code snippets for beginners in GDK to get off to a good start.   While designing app for Google Glass it is crucial to focus on its main features, like hands free operations. Instead of adapting functionality from our smartphone apps we need to focus how to enrich user experience in cases when they cannot hold smartphone in their hand. Voice recognition is definitely next benefit of using Google Glass and Google provides plenty of ways to explore it in our apps.	Erasmus Room 2

At Twitter, Andy Piper and his team helps developers making their apps better, by giving them crash reporting, analytics and beta distribution sdks. In his talk Andy Piper will show all the advanced techniques that Twitter uses to develop useful, stable, powerful SDKs that can help to leverage the code quality in your apps too.   There are several challenges when developing an Android SDK and the SDK must include a readable and easy to use API. It has to be lightweight in size and in methods number, but it has to be powerful in features. Code has to be solid and for that you need testing running on CI. Conclusion: Great talk for anyone interested in learning how Twitter makes SDKs and how to improve the quality of your own apps.	University Room

During this presentation Vitaliy & Ostap will show how easily one can add support for Android Wear devices to your existing application. Besides that you will learn about UI/UX on small screen, project structure best practices and finally decide what platform has more perspective and is easier to work with from a developer point of view.   Smart watches software looks solid, but because of platform architecture limitations and poor API it is hard to write complex applications and totally impossible to write application running on watch. In case of Android Wear – software is not so polished but that only seems to be a matter of time. And of course because it’s Android – we can let our imagination go crazy.	Erasmus Room 1

In this Talk Aurelian will present some solutions that enable wearable devices to assist drivers and car enthusiasts.   You will be shown several solutions that enable Android applications to assist the drivers when they are on the move. Smart watches can be used to track different events on the road, or simply launch on the fly car self-tests. Drivers can also receive notifications, like high speed, high economy, from their cars directly on their watches, whenever an event occurs. ODB II standard provides a list of error codes that are sent through a Bluetooth communication channel and processed by the Android application. Users can see details about the standard error codes, directly on the watch, when they are received. Smart watches offer a way to access all this information, and much more, easily, fast.

To demonstrate this Hoi has pulled together a demo app that randomly selects and loads a pannable image of the Apollo landing sites. So why did he pick the moon? Well, he says it’s cool (it’s the moon after all!) and it shows the finer points around how to use some of the key APIs on Android Wear.   In this talk, Hoi will focus on sharing the lessons learned and share code snippets like:   - DataApi – why is my Android Wear app not receiving the data it’s expecting from the phone? - Loading images – how should I load an image from a URL and pull it across to Android Wear? - Advance UI – how do I enable full screen swiping on Android Wear?

In his talk Tony Atkins will talk about hidden accessibility features your apps may already have , why your users need the GPII, and how to add support to your apps.   Android provides a low-cost platform that allows people to interact with the world on their own terms. This platform is powerful, but the power to configure these options is limited to people who can see and touch the device. Even for people who can see and touch a device, each new device requires days or weeks of adjustment to get back to the same comfort level. The Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure helps ensure that each new device adapts to a user’s needs from the moment they start using it. The GPII also helps devices keep up with a user’s needs as they change.	University Room

The talk will present an overview of what are the components of the Android UI subsystem, and of the 2D rendering pipeline and its components. There is no trace on the Internet of a comprehensive and easy-to-understand guide that covers every and all aspects of the Android UI subsystem. Skia, a pretty important component, for example, has almost no documentation at all.   Conclusion: This “missing documentation”, gathered by looking at the AOSP code and putting various pieces together, is condensed in a talk. The session will help developers master their UIs, optimise their graphics handling, and ultimately grip the base concepts that allow to create beautiful Views with the minimum effort and the best performances.
